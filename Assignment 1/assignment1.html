    About Page:


I’d say I’m more of a designer than a coder. I have skills creating with Illustrator, After Effects, and Premier. I like the visual in that sense. I do also have a bit of a technical background, though it’s not very thorough. I know a bit of CSS, HTML, and Processing. Essentially, it’s just enough to get by in this class.

I hope to not only learn more design capabilities, but also to build on my technical foundation. I’d say the technical component is my priority as that is where I am the least comfortable. I’d like to know how to translate my vision to a reality in most cases by using the different languages that we’ll learn in this class. I’d like to be able to make atypical website designs with a cool sense of interactivity.

Reading Response:

I think what is interesting about this reading is this notion of “context.” The writer’s interpretation of context is something active and fluid – a verb. What’s interesting is how though content can be referred to in “most cases” as static - the noun, it can also be fluid and ever evolving. It makes me realize that with the internet basically being a makeup of nodes, is “alive” given the interconnected information and content that evolves and is transmitted across these nodes. The author says it’s like “giving birth” putting content on the internet. What’s also interesting is this notion of chaos vs. order on the internet. Chaos theory says that chaos, though it may be disorderly, is not random. This means that there is actually an underlying set of rules and order that makes up chaos. There is an essence a balance between chaos and order through memetic engineering.
